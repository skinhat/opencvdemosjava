This is a conversion of the OpenCV Corner Harris Demo into Java from C++. It uses OpenCV 3.00 therefore doesn't use Highgui. It is a conversion of:

https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/tutorial_code/TrackingMotion/cornerHarris_Demo.cpp

from:
http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/features2d/trackingmotion/harris_detector/harris_detector.html

I will add more demos if I convert them.
